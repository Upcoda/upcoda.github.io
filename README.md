hey! upcoda here, i don't know how you found this but i'm glad you found my code! unfortunately the css is mythologized to optimize as much as possible the web, it sounds silly but to compensate this i wanted to explain the html as simple as it looks. sorry for this, anyway i still don't have time to explain the css with notes below the code, but i still thank you for the understanding.

thanks :)

also, I'm sorry if the project is not so tidy, honestly I'm in other things and I only had 3 days.
